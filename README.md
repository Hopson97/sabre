Client Server library thing built on top of SFML 2.4.2

For now it is for personal use so it can't really be built (I have [script kiddie scripts](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/blob/master/udp-rect-keys/scripts/getsabre.sh) for this) and no docs for now, but I have public for those who are curious.

## History

This was originally from [socket playground](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground) repo, where I began creating a mini library [here](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/tree/527e13209ab201c636887df440ddf59d33fbaf8d/udp-rect-keys/lib/libnet), but I decided it made more sense to have as a separate repo and then include in as needed, as this meant it would be easier to handle across separate projects of my own.

In the future I may or may not make it into an actual library, however this shouldn't really be used outside of hobby projects as I really making this only for learning purposes and am pretty new to network programming.

It's also pretty terrible performance wise.

Then why is it here? 

To show people what you shouldn't do when it comes to beginner game networking.
