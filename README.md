Client Server library thing built ontop of SFML 2.4.2

For now it is for personal use so it can't really be built (I have [script kiddie scripts](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/blob/master/udp-rect-keys/scripts/getsabre.sh) for this) and no docs for now, but I have public for those who are curious.

## History

This was originally from [socket playground](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground) repo, where I began creating a mini library [here](https://github.com/Hopson97/socket-playground/tree/527e13209ab201c636887df440ddf59d33fbaf8d/udp-rect-keys/lib/libnet), but I decided it made more sense to have as a seperate repo and then include in as needed, as this meant it would be easier to handle across seperate projects of my own.

In the future I may or may not make it into amn actual library, however this shouldn't really be used outside of hobby projects as I really making this only for learning purposes and am pretty new to network programming.
